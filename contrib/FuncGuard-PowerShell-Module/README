FuncGuard PowerShell Module
===========================

Overview
--------
Function guards (FuncGuards) are a debug tracing feature provided by the
N++CR npp_debug header.  FuncGuards provide a common interface for debug
statements and gives the ability to enable or disable multiple related
FuncGuards with a single statement.

While this is very helpful it can lead to some issues with making sure that
the main source repository does not get polluted with various guards that
are either enabled or disabled, and that the source stays clean.  To take
care of that the git repository is setup to track four files that list,
enable, disable, and make available all of the FuncGuards.  That can be
tedious to manage when actively working on different topics.

That is where this module helps.  It takes care of the adding, removing,
and modifying of the headers and source files so you don't need to.  It
can be used to control different projects and to update private groups or
templates of enabled/disabled FuncGuards that you may use often.

Requirements
------------
	* PowerShell v2
	* PSUnit (if you want to run the unit tests)
	* C++ project that uses npp_debug


Installation
-------------------

Start from Windows Explorer:
	- Double click the N++CR FuncGuards shortcut.

Start from a PowerShell prompt:
	- change directories to $N++CR_Root\contrib\FuncGuard-PowerShell-Module\FuncGuard
	- execute FuncGuard-Setup.ps1

PowerShell, like most other command line utilities allows for temporary, session
only setup of an environment, or a setup that persists for any new session
started.  To setup FuncGuards for every Powershell session you start, you need
to:
	- Copy the contents of this ($N++CR_Root\contrib\FuncGuard-PowerShell-Module)
	folder to your $Home\(My )Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ folder and edit
	your PowerShell profile to load the FuncGuard module.


Usage
-------------------
Get-Command -module FuncGuard
help <command>
